# Emoji Censor

A script to censor out any emoji characters in a piece of text, either visually or audibly.

## Why would anyone want such a thing?

Maybe you‚Äôre a curmudgeon like me. Maybe you just think it would have tremendous comedic value.

Really, this all started with a tweet from [Ben Buchanan](http://weblog.200ok.com.au/):

> Fun game: mentally replace all emoji with a censorship bleep.

The best way to describe it properly is to just link to the demo, so go play with it: [gilmoreorless.github.io/emoji-censor](https://gilmoreorless.github.io/emoji-censor/)


## Usage

Include the `emoji-censor.js` file into your project ‚Äì the API sits on a global variable named `emojiCensor`.

### `speakCensored(text)`

Uses the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) and [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) to speak the provided text out loud. Any emoji characters are replaced with a [censorship bleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleep_censor).

For example:

```js
emojiCensor.speakCensored('What a nice cat. üê±');
```

This will announce `"What a nice cat. [bleep]"` using text-to-speech synthesis.

### `redactElements(selector)`

Applies [redaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitization_(classified_information)) to HTML elements by blacking out emoji characters.

The `selector` argument is any valid CSS selector that can be passed to `document.querySelectorAll()`.

```js
// Example: This will black out any emoji within `.content` and its children.
emojiCensor.redactElements('.content');
```

This API is also aliased as `emojiCensor.redactioAdAbsurdum()`, purely because I liked the pun.

### Utilities

There are some simple utility methods that are required to make the main methods work, exposed on the API for convenience.

#### `hasEmoji(text)`

Tests if the provided `text` contains emoji characters, returning a boolean. This is just a wrapper around the [emoji-regex](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/emoji-regex) library.

```js
emojiCensor.hasEmoji('Approved ‚úî');  // false
emojiCensor.hasEmoji('Approved ‚úÖ');  // true
```

#### `splitText(text)`

Splits the given `text` into an array of parts based on the location of emoji characters. Each member of the array is an object containing two properties:

* `isEmoji` ‚Äì (`boolean`) `true` if the text is an emoji character, `false` otherwise
* `text` ‚Äì (`string`) the text content of the part

```js
emojiCensor.splitText('Hi there. üëãüèº Nice to meet you.');
/*
 * Return value:
 *
 * [
 *   { isEmoji: false, text: 'Hi there. ' },
 *   { isEmoji: true,  text: 'üëãüèº' },
 *   { isEmoji: false, text: ' Nice to meet you.' }
 * ]
 */
```

#### `isAudioSupported()`

Returns a boolean indicating if speaking censored text is supported in the user‚Äôs browser.
